    <h2 class="ccm-block-page-title page-title">Core Facilities Berlin</h2>


    <p>Several core facilities centralize expertise and equipment in Berlin to support translational
        cancer research. Facilities are set up for amplicon panel analysis, metabolomics, mass
        cytometry (CyTOF2), small animal imaging and biobanking. DKTK researchers also have access
        to further facilities at the Charit&eacute;, Max-Delbr&uuml;ck Centrum (MDC) and Berlin
        Institute of Health (BIH), which include Genomics, Proteomics, Bioinformatics, IT, Chemical
        Biology, Stem Cells and Transgenics Cores</p>

    <p>The 4C-PMU is a joint cancer sequencing initiative of the Charit&eacute; Comprehensive Cancer
        Center (CCCC), DKTK, and the Laboratory of Molecular Tumor Pathology (MTP), and the
        molecular pathology unit at the Institute of Pathology. The sequencing unit houses two Ion
        Torrent PGM systems, one Ion Chef and one Illumina MiSeq system (Fig. 1). Sequencing
        approaches are focused on customized and commercially available gene panels permitting
        in-depth analysis of heterogeneous cancer samples. Specific gene panels were developed for
        the following cancer entities: colon cancer, head and neck carcinoma, lymphoma,
        neuroendocrine carcinomas, breast cancer and leukemia. Panels for ovarian cancer, pediatric
        tumors, and melanoma and are still under development. Two Droplet Digital PCR systems and
        two StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR systems were installed for the validation of the sequencing
        data. The analysis of liquid biopsy samples is currently being developed for head and neck
        cancer. The 4C-PMU performs on request companion diagnostics based on NGS analysis within
        clinical trials organized at the CCCC.<br />Bioinformatics analysis is done as a community
        effort conducted mainly by local DKTK groups, and supported by the Computational Modeling
        Group at IRI (Humboldt University) and the informatics unit (CUBI) at the Berlin Institute
        of Health (BIH).</p>

    <p>The metabolome reflects the current functional status of the cell. Metabolomic changes play a
        central role in the pathogenesis and therapy of malignant diseases. The at the DKTK partner
        site Berlin established gas chromatography, coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry
        (GC-MS), is a sensitive and robust platform for the analysis of metabolites of the primary
        metabolism (amino acids, sugars, nucleic acids) (Fig. 2). This technique offers a broad
        applicability in tumor biology and interdisciplinary problems. The MS technology (APCI
        Q-TOF) allows quantitative statements and is particularly suitable for the elucidation of
        the structure of unknown analytes and for the analysis of very small samples volumes.
        Metabolic flux analysis is currently under establishment. As increasingly important
        extension of other, in Berlin reproached omics platforms, the cancer metabolomics platform
        enables functional, systems biology insights into the tumor metabolism and contributes to
        the identification of novel therapeutic principles.</p>

    <p>For innovative biomedical research scientists need high-quality biomaterials such as blood,
        urine and tissue samples and treatment data. The biobank service not only includes all steps
        of the processing chain from surgery to storage but also includes services covering many
        aspects of tissues such as histology, immunphenotyping, RNA/DNA extraction and all steps of
        quality control. A major focus is the handling and storage of fresh tumor tissues. The
        Charit&eacute; Biobank ZeBanC provides a total number of 2.5 Mill FFPE samples (10,000
        cancer patients/per year = 100,000 FFPE samples per year) and 100,000 fresh frozen samples.

    <p>With the <a href="https://dktk.dkfz.de/en/clinical-platform/working-groups-partners/ccp-bio">joint
            biobank</a>, in which Charit&eacute; and BIH invest a total of 3.9 million euros, better
        conditions for successful, independent and internationally competitive translational
        research will be provided. The new biobank building will be located at the Charit&eacute;
        Campus and completed by April 2016.</p>

    <p>Charit&eacute; is also the host for the BMBF-funded German Biobank Node (GBN) and acts via
        BBMRI as a hub for the European biobank infrastructure BBMRI-ERIC.<br />
        Notably, the Charit&eacute; also hosts specialized collections of tumor specimens including
        the Tumor bank Ovarian Carcinoma (TOC), the German Breast Group Biobank and biobanks for
        pediatric relapsed ALL, central nervous system lymphomas and brain tumors.</p>

    <p>The BERIC offers as a core facility of the Charit&eacute; all modalities of modern hybrid
        small animal imaging with radiopharmaceuticals.</p>
    <p>The multidisciplinary team is using its expertise and the latest state-of-the-art equipment
        (SPECT / CT, PET / MR; Angiography/PET, Fig. 2) available to users. The service offered
        includes all steps from consulting to study design, the tracer selection, tracer production,
        keeping of radioactive animals, conduction of the animal experiments, including image and
        data analysis and data storage as well as post mortem biodistribution experiments. The BERIC
        also offers services such as radiolabeling of ligands, in vitro evaluation of tracers and
        the generation of (genetically modified) cell lines and animal models (orthotopic,
        subcutaneous and metastatic tumor, stroke and myocarditis models etc.). Own research
        interests within the BERIC concentrate on the development and characterization of new
        radiotracers and theranostics for various tumor entities, as well as the development of new
        quantitative multi-parametric imaging approaches.</p>
